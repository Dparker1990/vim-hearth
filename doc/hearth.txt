*hearth.txt*  Turbo Clojure testing for fireplace.vim

Author:  Joshua Davey <http://joshuadavey.com/>
License: Same terms as Vim itself (see |license|)

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

This plugin can optionally be used with tmux panes, via tslime.vim or vimux,
whichever is available, or within vim itself.

It depends on fireplace.vim.

INTRODUCTION                                    *hearth*

Hearth is designed to speed up your Clojure TDD (clojure.test) cycle
by using a single key mapping to run the most relevant test file based
on the current file in vim. It depends on |fireplace| to determine
current namespace and relevant test namespace.

The default mapping for invoking the plugin is <leader>t. The behavior
after this depends on if you have a leinigen REPL (nREPL) running or
not.

With a REPL running, running <leader>t will reload the relevant test
namespace and send something like the following to the REPL:
>
        (clojure.test run-tests 'your.test-namespace :reload-all)
<
If no repl is running, it will just run the following command via
whichever runner you have chosen:
>
        clj path/to/file.clj
<
To choose a runner, see |hearth-runners|.

Note: If you're using this with a separate tmux pane, this plugin does
not work well with |autochdir|. The working directories for the target
pane and vim should match.


RUNNERS                                          *hearth-runners*

Below are the available runners. If an option is set, the plugin
automatically chooses one based on the first available from the valid
list.
>
          g:hearth_repl_runner      {vimux, tslime, fireplace}
          g:hearth_command_runner   {vimux, tslime, vim}

To explicitly set a runner, put something like the following into your
vimrc:
>
          let g:hearth_repl_runner='fireplace'
          let g:hearth_command_runner='vim'
<

MAPPING                                          *hearth-mappings*

The following map is always available:

<Plug>RunClojureTest              Run clojure test

And the following is available within clojure files, unless
"g:no_hearth_mappings" is set:

<leader>t                         Run clojure test

To use custom mappings, you can put something like the following in your
vimrc:
>
          let g:no_hearth_mappings = 1
          map <leader>rt <Plug>RunClojureTest
<
